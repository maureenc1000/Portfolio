This project is a simple Python application that connects to a public Weather API to retrieve real-time weather data for a specified city. The script sends an HTTP request to the API, receives weather information in JSON format, and displays key details such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed in a readable format.

The project demonstrates the use of:

API integration using the requests library

Handling JSON data

Error handling for invalid input or failed API calls

Basic user input processing
